## Overview
**OPTIMUS** is a predictive and explainable machine-learning analysis for modeling multivariate cognitive and behavioral outcomes in Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) using multimodal data. It addresses challenges of missing data and aims to provide biological interpretability of predictive models.

The analysis covers:
- Missing data handling and imputation benchmarking
- Predictive modeling with classical and deep learning approaches
- Explainability using perturbation-based post-hoc model agnostic methods
- Brain mapping to contextualize feature attributions anatomically

---

## Objective
Alzheimerâ€™s Disease involves complex neural, genetic, and proteomic factors affecting multiple cognitive domains. OPTIMUS aims to:
- Integrate multimodal data (neuroimaging, transcriptomics, genotyping, CSF biomarkers).
- Predict multivariate outcomes across memory, executive, language, and visuospatial domains.
- Handle missingness without losing biological signal.
- Identify key biomarkers and map them back to brain anatomy for interpretation.

## Methods

### Notebooks Overview
The project is organized into modular notebooks, each addressing a specific component of the OPTIMUS workflow:  

| Notebook                                  | Purpose                                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1-data_exploration.ipynb**              | Prepares and harmonizes multi-modal data (neuroimaging, genetic, proteomic), including feature engineering and scaling. |
| **2-imputation_analysis.ipynb**           | Benchmarks multiple imputation strategies (e.g., MissForest, KNN, IterativeImputer) for handling missing data across modalities. |
| **3-train-test_model_selection.ipynb**    | Implements predictive modeling with selected imputation strategies, using train-test split. Includes TabNet and classical models. |
| **4-loco-cv_model_selection.ipynb**       | Conducts leave-one-complete-out cross-validation (LOCO-CV) for model evaluation.               |
| **5-lomo-cv_model_selection.ipynb**       | Conducts leave-one-missing-out cross-validation (LOMO-CV) to assess model robustness to missingness. |
| **6-captum_feature_analysis.ipynb**       | Applies explainable AI methods (Captum perturbation-based explainers) to analyze feature importances per cognitive domain. |
| **7-feature_attribution_brain_maps.ipynb**| Projects neuroimaging feature importances onto cortical surfaces using Nilearn and the Schaefer 200-region atlas for functional interpretation. |
| **8-extra_hyperparameter_selection.ipynb**| Performs additional hyperparameter tuning for selected models on random patient subsets.         |

### Multi-modal Data
OPTIMUS is trained on data from **1,205 individuals** in the ADNI cohort:  
- **348** cognitively normal (CN)  
- **601** mild cognitive impairment (MCI)  
- **256** Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD)  

Modalities include:  
- **Neuroimaging** (MRI-derived cortical thickness and subcortical volumes)  
- **Genetic data** (APOE genotype, transcriptomics)  
- **Proteomics** (CSF biomarkers, plasma proteins)  

---

### Missing Data Handling
Imputation methods are benchmarked across multi-modal datasets using **2-imputation_analysis.ipynb**, assessing their ability to recover missing values while preserving inter-modal relationships.  

---

### Predictive Modeling
Predictive modeling pipelines are implemented across several notebooks:  
- **3-train-test_model_selection.ipynb:** Train-test split modeling.  
- **4-loco-cv_model_selection.ipynb:** Leave-one-complete-out CV.  
- **5-lomo-cv_model_selection.ipynb:** Leave-one-missing-out CV for robustness testing.  

Models include:  
- **Classical models:** MultiTaskElasticNet, MultiTaskLasso, Partial Least Squares (PLS), XGBoost  
- **Deep learning models:** TabNet (via PyTorch Tabular)  

The **8-extra_hyperparameter_selection.ipynb** notebook performs advanced hyperparameter searches.

### Explainable AI (XAI)
The **6-captum_feature_analysis.ipynb** notebook integrates multiple perturbation-based explainability methods from Captum:  
- FeatureAblation  
- FeaturePermutation  
- Occlusion  
- ShapleyValueSampling  
- Lime  
- KernelShap  

Metrics such as **Infidelity** and **Sensitivity Max** are used for method evaluation.

### Neuroimaging Visualization
The **7-feature_attribution_brain_maps.ipynb** notebook uses Nilearn to project cortical feature importances onto brain surfaces for functional interpretation, utilizing the Schaefer atlas.  

---

## Results
OPTIMUS identifies:  
- **Multi-modal biomarker patterns** relevant to specific cognitive domains.  
- Robust feature attributions across classical and deep learning models.  
- Neuroimaging regions whose importance is consistent across explainability methods.

## Significance
This framework demonstrates:  
- The value of **multi-modal integration** in AD research.  
- Effective **missing data handling** strategies.  
- **Interpretable models** for biomarker discovery and hypothesis generation.
