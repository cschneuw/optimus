## Overview
**OPTIMUS** is a predictive, modular, and explainable machine-learning framework designed to model **multivariate cognitive and behavioral outcomes** in Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) using **multi-modal data**, while explicitly addressing **missing values**. OPTIMUS integrates:

- **Missing data handling** strategies to recover missing values while preserving biological relevance.
- **Attention-based predictive modeling** tailored for structured multi-modal data.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)** to uncover interpretable relationships between biomarkers and cognitive outcomes.

---

## Objective
Alzheimerâ€™s Disease is driven by a complex interplay of neural, genetic, and proteomic factors, impacting multiple cognitive domains. Traditional approaches often predict **univariate outcomes**, such as disease progression or severity scores. OPTIMUS goes beyond by:

- **Integrating multi-modal data**, including imaging, genetic, and proteomic features.
- **Predicting multivariate outcomes**, capturing multiple cognitive and behavioral functions simultaneously.
- **Handling missing data** with dedicated strategies to maximize usable data.

## Methods

### 1. Multi-modal Data
OPTIMUS is trained on data from **1,205 individuals**, spanning:
- **346** cognitively normal (CN) participants
- **608** individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
- **251** individuals diagnosed with Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD)

**Data modalities include:**
- **Neuroimaging** (e.g., MRI-based features)
- **Genetic data** (e.g., gene expression and APOE genotype)
- **Proteomic profiles** (e.g., CSF biomarkers)

---

### 2. Missing Data Handling
OPTIMUS applies **generalized imputation techniques** rather than strictly modality-specific imputation, ensuring that missing values are addressed while maintaining data integrity.

---

### 3. Predictive Modeling
OPTIMUS predicts **multivariate cognitive outcomes**, including:
- Executive function
- Language
- Memory
- Visuospatial function

**Core modeling approach:**
- **TabNet**, a deep learning model optimized for tabular data, enhanced with:
  - **Sparse feature selection** via attention mechanisms.
  - **Comprehensive evaluation** across multiple validation strategies.

**Validation strategies include:**
- **Train-test split** for initial evaluation.
- **Leave-one-complete-sample-out cross-validation** to test generalizability.
- **Leave-one-missing-sample-out cross-validation** to assess robustness in missing data scenarios.

---

### 4. Explainable AI (XAI)
OPTIMUS incorporates explainability directly into its modeling pipeline, using TabNetâ€™s attention masks to:
- Identify the **most influential features per cognitive outcome**.
- Aggregate feature importance across decision steps.
- Compare attention-based explanations with alternative techniques, including:
  - **Permutation importance**
  - **Shapley values**

**Key visual outputs include:**
- **Volcano plots** highlighting differentially expressed genes.
- **Heatmaps** summarizing normalized gene expression profiles.
- **Aggregated feature importance plots** across cognitive domains.

---

## Results
- OPTIMUS identifies **multi-modal biomarkers** spanning neuroimaging, genetic, and proteomic data.
- These biomarkers **jointly but differentially** predict distinct cognitive outcomes.
- The model uncovers **many-to-many predictive pathways**, linking biomarkers to specific cognitive functions.

---

## Significance
OPTIMUS demonstrates the power of:
- **Multi-modal data integration** to capture the heterogeneous pathology of AD.
- **Imputation strategies** tailored to preserve data integrity.
- **Attention-based models** to enhance prediction accuracy and interpretability.
- **Explainable AI** to reveal biologically meaningful relationships between biomarkers and cognitive decline.

This work advances our understanding of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease by offering a robust, interpretable framework for modeling cognitive decline.
